# Temperature-Converter
I was not feeling up to continuing the 100 day challenge so I created a simple project as a way to keep myself engaged. 
This is one of the classics, a temperature Converter. It is Java Swing project and recently it has been interesting to do projects using the Swing GUI. 
Ignore the man.java file. I forgot to remove it.
